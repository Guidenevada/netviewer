# netviewer

this is not a honey pot, this is a simple tool that will try to save the machine.

What do I need to do?
  - use ettercap to do a MITM attack or be the router to see every net trame
  - find the virus is every trame and focus on the virus specific port
  - print the command, the potential result but send a false output
  - if there is any algorithm like base64, binary convertion or any other convertion, be able to detect them and print the text as it should be


Roadmap:
  - code a listener and see what will hapen
  - test many thing to look like the real virus. 
  - try to be compotible with most of listener, even a listener who is writen to be undetectable
